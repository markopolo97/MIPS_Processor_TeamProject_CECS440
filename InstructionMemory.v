 * File Name:  Data_Memory.v
 * Project:    Lab 4
 * Designers:  Mark Aquiapao and TrieuVy Le
 * Rev. No.:   Version 1.0
 * Rev. Date:  Mar. 5, 2019 
 *
 * Purpose:    The module is to be organized as a 4096x8 Byte addressable MEM.
 * When writing to Data_Memory, it is to be synchrous with the clock.
 * When reading to Data_Memory, it is to be asynchrous due to that it is not 
 * depending on the clock. 
 * Either to read/write to memory, the chip select signal (dm_cs) must be 
 * asserted with the proper read or write control signals. 
 * The output is to have tri-state outputs labeled as z.
